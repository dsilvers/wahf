                                pilots and people involved in aviation, seemingly flying into history or whatever was most interesting.

                                        Some of the names are well known, old friends to those in aviation circles.
                                        <b>Alfred Kelch Jr.</b> was first introduced to flying at 6 by an uncle, Percy Bricker, back in young Alfred’s Iowa hometown.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Uncle Percy, he later said, gave <mark>“me an incurable disease that’s very expensive.”</mark>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The same uncle gave him his first flying lesson while Alfred was still in junior high.
                                        Kelch grew up to become an inventor and manufacturer—and bought his first plane as soon as he could afford it.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It was an antique Piper Cub, the first of many vintage models.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        “He loved antique aircraft—it had to be antique,” said wife Lois.
                                        Kelch eventually moved his aircraft to the airport in Brodhead Airport (C37), now the home of the <a href="https://www.kelchmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Kelch Aviation Museum</a>, in Brodhead, Wisconsin.
                                        Other Kelch calls to fame included early and active involvement in the <a href="https://eaavintage.org/alfred-kelch/" target="_blank">Experimental Aircraft Association’s Vintage Aircraft</a> division and editing its <i><a href="https://www.eaa.org/eaa/news-and-publications/eaa-magazines-and-publications/vintage-airplane-magazine" target="_blank">Vintage Airplane</a></i> magazine with Lois.

                                        then served as a wartime instructor of air cadets in the Navy’s flight training program.

                                    <p>
                                        After the war, he showed up at Curtiss-Wright Airport, and asked about a part-time job as a pilot-instructor.

                                        He began Gran-Aire Inc. at the airfield, now better known as Milwaukee County’s Timmerman Airport (KMWC).

                                        Over the years he taught something like 1,200 students, including military fliers, and logged more than 21,000 hours.
                                        For those efforts and more, he was <a href="https://www.wahf.org/hall-of-fame/william-j-bill-lotzer/">inducted into the Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame in 1991</a>.

                                        “What they’d done is work all night and gotten this plane cannibalized,” he later said in a newspaper interview. “They had these great big smelly, rusty, old bombs.”

                                        “This is a completely suicidal mission,” he remembered thinking. “But we went anyway. We were damn fortunate we didn’t find anything.”

                                        They were less fortunate as they returned that night. Low on fuel, they found themselves under attack by American forces who thought the Japanese were returning. They managed to find another landing strip and survive another day.

                                        Other wartime memories made for happier stories. While at the Hollywood Canteen in 1945, film star Bette Davis took him by the hand for a dance. And on a Florida beach with buddies, he got Rita Hayworth's autograph. Malecki remembered seeing the actress in the brilliant sunlight and thinking she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He said her then-husband, actor and director Orson Welles, seemed like an old grouch.

                                        After earning her wings in the 1940s, she was allowed to leave her civilian defense job to enlist with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_Airforce_Service_Pilots" target="_blank">Women Airforce Service Pilots.</a>

                                        While many women applied, only about 1,100 served with WASP.
                                        All were already pilots who trained and flew under the direction of the Army Air Forces.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Kapus flew BT-13s and many other aircraft, including co-piloting the B-17.

                                        “I was placed in ferrying and engineering test flying,” she said in the book,

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        “Test flying meant that I tested aircraft when replacement parts were put on, like a new wing, engine, or aileron.
                                        So if they put on a new wing, I had to go up and see if it would really fly.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <mark>“We were all driven by a love of flying and a feeling of duty to serve the country for which our sons, brothers, husbands, and friends were fighting,”</mark> Kapus said.

                                        A total of 38 WASP pilots, then classified as civilians, died in service.
                                        Their bodies were returned at family expense and without military honors. After the WASP was disbanded, records were classified and sealed for decades.
                                        Military status and honors finally came in 1977 with an act of Congress, posthumous recognition for many.

                                        Kapus was a rare exception with veteran status. She received a commission with the U.S. Air Force, first with the reserve, after the war.
                                        Despite her skill—and breaking and rebreaking spin records—she was denied the chance to serve as a pilot.

                                        “I was told ‘only <i>male</i> personnel are rated’ to be pilots,” she said.

                                        One story proved too good to wait until the pilot was deceased.
                                        So it was that advance research for a future obituary on <b>James A. Lovell</b> became a piece for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 13 mission.
                                        Astronaut Lovell, a Navy pilot who grew up in Milwaukee, talked about the mission now known as NASA’s “successful failure.”
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        “People often ask us, ‘Did you panic at all?’ There was no sense to panicking.
                                        We just had to figure out how to get home,” Lovell said in that pre-obit interview.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <mark>“The real meaning of 13 was the ability of people to handle the problems and get home safely,”</mark> he said, crediting the work of everyone involved with Mission Control.
                                        “Survival was the only thing on our minds at the time.”
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Still that most successful survival did not mean Lovell didn’t miss his chance to walk on the moon.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        “For several years after, I looked at it with a sense of frustration that I didn’t land on the moon,” he said.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        That changed with time.

                                        “I looked at it as a triumph of the human ability to snatch success from almost certain disaster,” Lovell said. “So there’s mixed emotions.”

                                    <p>
                                        Perhaps one of the most memorable stories was that of <b>Majorie Bong Drucker</b>, whose portrait was painted on the nose of a P-38 Lightning fighter during WWII. It was flown by Maj. Richard Bong.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        He came to be called America’s “Ace of Aces”—decades later, <a href="https://www.wahf.org/hall-of-fame/richard-bong/">named to the Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame.</a>
                                        She became known as his sweetheart and then bride, their wedding the stuff of Hollywood newsreels.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Six months later, she was a widow after Bong died while testing the Air Force’s first jet, the F-80 Shooting Star, in 1945.
                                        She learned of his death while listening to the radio.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        After his funeral back home in northern Wisconsin, she disappeared from the public eye, returning to California where they had been stationed.
                                        She eventually remarried and became the mother of two daughters, who were surprised when they learned just how famous their mother and her first husband were.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        She returned to Wisconsin many years later to help dedicate the Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge,
                                        connecting Superior with Duluth, Minnesota, and found new purpose working on behalf of veterans.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I remember interviewing her family, working from the dining room table at home one evening in 2003.
                                        The next morning, I rushed to the newsroom, dropped my notes on the desk and went right to the Journal Sentinel photo library, hoping there would be an old file with Richard Bong’s name on it.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There was.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <mark>Dozens of photos spilled out.</mark>
                                        Marjorie taking cookies out of the oven for the returning hero.
                                        The happy couple leaving the church after their wedding.
                                        A solemn young widow walking between his mother and hers as they arrived for the funeral.
                                        And, of course, the photos of her face on the nose of his plane.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The best Marjorie story, though, happened when she was visiting the EAA Aviation Museum.
                                        There was a P-38 Lightning, an exact replica of the “Marge” plane. A man near her wondered aloud whatever happened to Marge.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Marjorie Bong Drucker stuck out her left hand, putting the fingers of her right hand on her pulse.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        “She’s still doing all right, as far as I can tell,” she told him.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <mark>“Oh, my God, I’m talking to Marge!” the man responded.</mark>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        While she is no longer with us, she lives on in aviation history just as her famous husband does.
                                        So, too, do all the other high-flying heroes and enthusiasts, each contributing in their own ways to the history of flight.
                                        It is an honor—again—to share their stories.
                                    </p>
